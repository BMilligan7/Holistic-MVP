## Epic 4: Task Management & Tracking (Primarily Sprint 3)

*   **Goal:** Translate plans into daily tasks and allow users to track their completion.
*   **User Stories / Tasks:**
    *   **US015:** As a user with generated plans, I want the system to automatically break down my Exercise, Nutrition, and Sleep plans into specific, actionable daily tasks, so that I have a clear daily checklist.
    *   **Task015:** Implement logic (AI-based or rule-based) to parse `Plan.plan_content` and create corresponding entries in the `Task` table with appropriate descriptions and due dates.
    *   **US016:** As a user, I want a dashboard view where I can easily see my assigned tasks for the current day, so that I know what I need to accomplish.
    *   **US017:** As a user viewing my daily tasks, I want to be able to mark a task as 'completed', so that the system records my progress and adherence.
