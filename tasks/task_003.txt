# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Onboarding Quiz Wizard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the multi-step onboarding questionnaire to gather initial user data for personalization.
# Details:
1. Design the wizard UI with step indicators and navigation controls
2. Create ~7 core questions mixing MCQ and open-ended formats
3. Implement state management for the wizard using Zustand or Context API
4. Set up Supabase Function for processing onboarding answers
5. Integrate with external LLM API (Claude/GPT/Gemini) for potential dynamic follow-up questions
6. Store collected data in the user's profile
7. Implement progress saving to allow users to continue later
8. Add validation for required fields

# Test Strategy:
Test the wizard flow with various input combinations. Verify data is correctly saved to the profile. Test the dynamic follow-up question functionality with different initial responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Wizard UI Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall UI structure for the onboarding wizard that breaks down the complex process into sequential steps
### Details:
Design a modal window with clear navigation controls, progress indicators, and a consistent layout that guides users through the onboarding process. Include wireframes and mockups for different screen sizes.

## 2. Develop Question Creation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build a system to create, manage and organize onboarding quiz questions
### Details:
Create interfaces for defining question types (multiple choice, text input, etc.), validation rules, branching logic, and question dependencies. Include tools for question previewing and testing.

## 3. Implement State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop a robust state management system to handle user progress and responses
### Details:
Create a state management architecture that tracks user inputs, handles conditional logic between questions, manages validation states, and preserves the current session state. Include error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 4. Build Backend Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create APIs and services to connect the wizard frontend with backend systems
### Details:
Develop RESTful APIs for data exchange between the wizard and backend services. Include authentication, error handling, and logging capabilities to ensure reliable communication.

## 5. Integrate LLM API [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Connect the wizard with Language Learning Model APIs for intelligent response processing
### Details:
Implement integration with LLM APIs to analyze user responses, provide personalized feedback, and adapt question flow based on user inputs. Include fallback mechanisms for API failures.

## 6. Design Data Storage Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create a database schema and storage system for user responses and wizard configuration
### Details:
Design database models for storing question configurations, user responses, and session data. Include considerations for data security, performance optimization, and scalability.

## 7. Implement Progress Saving Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.6
### Description: Create functionality to save and restore user progress through the wizard
### Details:
Develop automatic and manual save points throughout the wizard flow. Implement session recovery, progress indicators, and the ability to resume from where users left off.

## 8. Build Validation and Completion System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Create comprehensive validation rules and completion handling for the wizard
### Details:
Implement input validation for all question types, overall wizard completion validation, and success/failure handling. Include user feedback mechanisms and next steps guidance upon completion.
