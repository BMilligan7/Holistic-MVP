# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Agent/Ask Model and Plan Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the core agentic workflow for the AI, enabling it to operate in different modes (e.g., proactive agent vs. responsive assistant) based on user preference. This includes implementing the logic for how the AI suggests and applies plan updates according to the selected Agent/Ask model.
# Details:
1. Update the profile schema to store the user's Agent/Ask preference
2. Develop and implement the distinct behavioral models for the AI based on the user's Agent/Ask preference. This includes how the AI processes information, makes decisions (e.g., proactively suggesting plan changes, automatically applying them, or requiring explicit user confirmation), and interacts with plan update mechanisms
3. Implement logic for the AI to suggest plan changes based on the active mode
4. Create functionality to apply plan updates (updating the `plans` table) according to the active Agent/Ask mode and user confirmations if required
5. Implement task regeneration after plan updates
6. Add notifications or visual indicators for plan changes
7. Create a history of plan versions

# Test Strategy:
Test all Agent/Ask modes (proactive agent, responsive assistant, etc.). Verify plan updates are correctly applied to the database according to each mode's behavior. Test user confirmation flows where required. Verify task regeneration after plan updates. Ensure notifications and history tracking work correctly across all modes.
