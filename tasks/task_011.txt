# Task ID: 11
# Title: Task #11: Refine Global Validation & Error Handling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive validation and error handling enhancements across the application, including utility functions, toast notifications, error boundaries, accessibility improvements, structured logging, and test coverage.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the application's validation and error handling capabilities:

1. Create reusable validation utility functions:
   - Develop a centralized validation library with functions for common validations (email, password strength, required fields, etc.)
   - Implement type validation helpers using TypeScript
   - Create form-specific validation utilities that can be composed for different form contexts

2. Implement toast notifications:
   - Set up react-hot-toast library with custom styling to match application design
   - Create different notification types (success, error, warning, info)
   - Implement auto-dismissal with appropriate timing
   - Ensure notifications are keyboard dismissible

3. Add React Error Boundaries:
   - Create a global ErrorBoundary component
   - Implement component-specific error boundaries for critical UI sections
   - Design fallback UI components for graceful degradation
   - Set up error reporting to logging service when boundaries catch errors

4. Improve error message accessibility:
   - Ensure all error messages have appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Implement focus management for form errors
   - Add screen reader announcements for dynamic error states
   - Ensure color is not the only indicator of errors (add icons, text)

5. Set up structured error logging:
   - Implement error categorization (UI, API, validation, etc.)
   - Add context information to logged errors (user ID, action being performed)
   - Set up error severity levels
   - Configure appropriate redaction of sensitive information

6. Add comprehensive test coverage:
   - Unit tests for validation utilities
   - Integration tests for error boundaries
   - Visual regression tests for error states
   - Accessibility tests for error messages

This task builds upon the initial validation work from Subtask 2.6 and should integrate with the existing analytics system from Task #10.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task will require a multi-faceted approach:

1. Validation Utility Functions:
   - Write unit tests for each validation function with positive and negative test cases
   - Test edge cases (empty strings, null values, special characters)
   - Verify validation functions work with internationalized content
   - Benchmark performance for complex validations

2. Toast Notifications:
   - Verify notifications appear and disappear correctly
   - Test stacking behavior with multiple notifications
   - Confirm keyboard accessibility (Esc to dismiss)
   - Test screen reader announcement of notifications
   - Verify notifications work across different screen sizes

3. Error Boundaries:
   - Create intentional errors to trigger boundaries
   - Verify fallback UI renders correctly
   - Confirm error reporting occurs when boundaries catch errors
   - Test nested error boundaries behave as expected

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (Axe, Lighthouse)
   - Perform manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
   - Verify keyboard navigation through error states
   - Test with high contrast mode and zoom settings

5. Error Logging:
   - Verify errors are properly categorized and formatted
   - Confirm sensitive data is not logged
   - Test that context information is correctly attached
   - Verify integration with monitoring tools

6. Integration Testing:
   - Test error handling across user flows
   - Verify form submissions with invalid data trigger appropriate responses
   - Test API error handling with mocked failed responses
   - Verify error states persist appropriately across navigation

7. End-to-end Testing:
   - Create Cypress tests that simulate error conditions
   - Verify the entire error handling flow from trigger to resolution

Acceptance Criteria:
- All validation utilities pass unit tests
- Toast notifications are visually correct and accessible
- Error boundaries catch errors without crashing the application
- All error messages meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Error logs contain appropriate context without sensitive data
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
